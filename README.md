This is a simple ruby wrapper implementation of IBM's Watson Natural Language Understanding API which is used to analyze text to extract meta-data from content

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'WatsonNLPWrapper'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install WatsonNLPWrapper

## Usage

```ruby
# Require the library
require "WatsonNLPWrapper"

# Initialize
# Version parameter is not needed to be sent and by default is 2018-03-16
nlp = WatsonNLPWrapper::WatsonNLPApi.new('{url}', '{username}', '{password}', '{version}')

# Set sample text
text = '{sample text}'

# Call the analyze API with default features
# This will give a json response
nlp.analyze(text)

# If you want to enable specific features only and not the default features

features =
  {
    entities: {
      emotion: true,
      sentiment: true,
      limit: 2
    },
    keywords: {
      emotion: true,
      sentiment: true,
      limit: 2
    }
  }

nlp.analyze(text, features)
```
